Buoy is a (what are you trying to convey with stating that it is community-based? I think the last paragraph states this more clearly and it's not needed here) crisis response platform that connects families, friends, and teams during emergency situations. (I removed the bit about 911 because it's tunnels in on one small aspect while trying to describe the large concept of what Buoy is; best to be concise first and descriptive later)

Buoy is a free (and open source, decentralized <----is this important to most end users? I'm one input but it did not add value to *me*; it's stated in the closing paragraph in a spot that makes more sense) tool designed to quickly alert and communicate with prescribed groups when assistance is needed.

Buoy allows users to create customized networks of trusted friends and allies and to organize and plan responses for emergency situations (is this true? I want to make sure my editing doesn't drift away from the core intent). In the case of an emergency, the user's Response Team can be alerted with one touch. The alert creates a real-time map of each team member's location, a live chat to coordinate a response, and live photo, audio, and video streaming capabilities (is this true?).

Buoy is a open source, decentralized technology that is designed to be community owned and operated. The tool has a unlimited range of potential uses. [use cases]({{ site.github.wiki_url }}/Buoy-Use-Cases)&mdash;Buoy is useful for everything from organizing a team of street medics during an action, copwatching, or facilating domestic violence victim support, to a local group of single parents coordinating rides for each others' kids from school or family checking in after a natural disaster. Buoy is responsive to the unique needs of the organization or community group that uses it.

In order to make this useful tool as accessible as possible to admins and developers of various skill levels, Buoy is implemented as a WordPress plugin. The platform integrates with other free software projects and services such as mapping with OpenStreetMap, video conferencing through Jitsi Meet, and offers advanced real-time location tracking and push notifications via HTML5 APIs.

We are dedicated to free and open source software principles and believe in the importance of technically-implemented decentralization in order to equitably distribute power. We have an explicitly anti-capitalist, anti-oppression, prison abolitionist, pro-community agenda and strive to incorporate that agenda into everything we do.
